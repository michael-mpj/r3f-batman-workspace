# Checklist for Architecture

This assessment checklist focuses on evaluating and enhancing the Architecture aspect of your systems, ensuring they are designed for scalability, resiliency, efficiency, disaster recovery, modularity, interoperability, simplicity, and observability. By adhering to core design principles, this checklist aims to help you build robust, agile, and scalable infrastructure that aligns with long-term vision and growth.

There will be clear differences between GitHub Enterprise Cloud and Server to consider, primarily due to Server being an on-premises self-hosted product.

## Scalability

### Repository Structure

Assess the organization and structure of repositories for clarity and scalability.
Determine whether repositories follow a naming convention, and ensure all repositories have a description.
Check for the use of custom properties to dynamically manage and enforce.
Verify that repositories are appropriately segmented as to avoid monolithic structures unnecessarily, or determine the necessity of such an architecture.
Check for the use of branch protection rules to maintain code quality.

### Code Modularity

Evaluate the modularity of the codebase for maintainability and scalability.
Ensure that code modules are reusable and loosely coupled.
Promote usage of design patterns that promote modularity.
Verify that dependencies between modules are well-documented.

### Tech Stack Consistency

Review the consistency of the technology stack across projects for efficiency and interoperability.
Ensure that the tech stack is standardized to reduce complexity.
Verify that the chosen technologies are well-supported and have a strong community.
Check for the use of version control to manage tech stack dependencies.

### Resource Management

Ensure ephemeral resources can be recreated on-demand.
Ensure non-ephemeral compute resources contains sufficient headroom from growth and scale.

Implement data replication strategies to ensure data is not lost in the event of a disaster.
Verify that disaster recovery plans include clear roles and responsibilities.
Be able to recover git repositories in the event users erroneously force push.

### Regular Testing

Verify that test results are documented and reviewed.
Ensure that any issues identified during testing are addressed.

### Data Replication

Implement data replication strategies to ensure data is not lost in the event of a disaster.
Ensure that replicated data is consistent and up-to-date.

## Modularity

### Service Separation

Ensure that application services are modular and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Verify that modules have clear and well-defined interfaces.

### Codebase Modularity

Assess the modularity of codebases to facilitate easier updates and maintenance.
Ensure that code modules are reusable and loosely coupled.
Check for the use of design patterns that promote modularity.
Verify that dependencies between modules are well-documented.

### Microservices Architecture

Check for the use of service discovery mechanisms.

## Interoperability

### API Integration

Ensure that APIs are well-documented and can be easily integrated with other systems.
Verify that APIs follow industry standards.
Ensure that APIs are versioned and backward compatible.
Check for the use of API gateways to manage and secure APIs.

### Standards Compliance

Ensure compliance with industry standards to facilitate interoperability.
Ensure compliance with license obligations for open sourced and vendor-managed software packages.
Verify that systems are compatible across different platforms and environments.
Check for the use of middleware to facilitate communication between different systems.
Ensure that data formats are standardized.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

## Observability

### Logging

Implement comprehensive logging to track system behavior and issues.
