# Markdown Rules

## General Guidelines

- Use consistent heading levels (start with #, avoid skipping levels).
- Keep lines under 80 characters for readability.
- Use descriptive link text (e.g., [GitHub Docs] instead of [project documentation]).
- Include alt text for images.

## Code Blocks

- Use fenced code blocks with language specifiers (e.g., ```bash).
- Indent inline code with backticks (`code`).

## Lists

- Use hyphens (-) for unordered lists.
- Use numbers (1.) for ordered lists.
- Nest lists with 2-space indentation.

## Tables

- Align columns with pipes (|).
- Use dashes (-) for headers.

## Best Practices

- Preview rendered output.
- Follow project style (e.g., no trailing spaces).
- Use relative links for internal references.
