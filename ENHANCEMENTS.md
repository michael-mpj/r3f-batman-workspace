# üöÄ R3F Workspace Monorepo ‚Äì Enhancements & Improvements

Review my current R3F workspace monorepo setup and suggest a detailed list of possible enhancements, improvements, and best practices. Include recommendations for: project structure, code quality, performance optimization (React + Three.js + R3F + Drei), state management (e.g., Zustand/Jotai/Recoil), modularity (shared packages, reusable components), build system (Vite/Turborepo/Next.js), testing (Vitest/Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for 3D interactions), linting & formatting (ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Vercel, Netlify), developer experience (Storybook, HMR, VSCode configs, typedoc), and deployment strategies. Please include both technical and organizational improvements that make the monorepo scalable, maintainable, and production-ready.

This document outlines recommended enhancements, improvements, and best practices to make the R3F (React Three Fiber) workspace monorepo **scalable, performant, and production-ready**.

---

## 1. üìÇ Project Structure & Monorepo Organization

- [ ] Use **Turborepo** or **Nx** for build orchestration and caching.
- [ ] Organize code into `apps/` (demos, playgrounds) and `packages/` (core, ui, scenes, shaders, utils).
- [ ] Centralize shared configs (`eslint`, `prettier`, `tsconfig`, `vite.config`).
- [ ] Define **code owners** for package responsibility.

---

## 2. üßπ Code Quality & Standards

- [ ] Strict **TypeScript** configs with path aliases (`@core`, `@ui`, etc.).
- [ ] Enforce **ESLint** with React, R3F, and import rules.
- [ ] Auto-format with **Prettier** + **Stylelint**.
- [ ] Add **commitlint**, **husky**, and **lint-staged** for consistent commits.

---

## 3. ‚ö° Performance Optimization

- [ ] Lazy-load heavy 3D assets (GLTF, textures) with React Suspense.
- [ ] Use drei optimizations: `<BakeShadows />`, `<AccumulativeShadows />`, `meshBounds`.
- [ ] Apply **draco/glTF compression** for models.
- [ ] Modularize shaders, reuse shader chunks.
- [ ] Optimize render loop: `frameloop="demand"` or `invalidateFrameloop`.
- [ ] Add **R3F Perf Monitor** for FPS/memory checks.

---

## 4. üîÑ State Management & Data Flow

- [ ] Use **Zustand** or **Jotai** for reactive scene state.
- [ ] Create a shared **@store** package (`useSceneStore`, `useUIStore`).
- [ ] Decouple business logic from rendering logic.
- [ ] Enable devtools (time-travel debugging).

---

## 5. üß© Reusable Components & Modularity

- [ ] Build a **shared components library** (`@ui`, `@r3f-components`) including:
  - `<SceneLayout />`, `<CameraController />`, `<LightingSetup />`
  - `<Environment />`, `<Loader />`, `<OverlayUI />`
- [ ] Provide utility hooks (`useGLTFLoader`, `useScrollControls`, `useAnimations`).
- [ ] Add **Storybook** for UI + 3D component previews.

---

## 6. üì¶ Build System & Bundling

- [ ] Use **Vite** with monorepo aliases.
- [ ] Add **bundle analysis** (`rollup-plugin-visualizer`).
- [ ] Enable **code splitting** & lazy scene loading.
- [ ] Add optional **SSR** via Next.js.

---

## 7. ‚úÖ Testing & Validation

- [ ] Unit tests with **Vitest** + **React Testing Library**.
- [ ] 3D interaction tests with **Playwright** or **Cypress**.
- [ ] Snapshot tests for GLTF validation.
- [ ] CI coverage reports with **Codecov**.

---

## 8. üîÅ CI/CD & Automation

- [ ] GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for build + lint + test on PR.
- [ ] Auto-publish packages with **changesets**.
- [ ] Deploy apps to **Vercel/Netlify**.
- [ ] PR preview builds (Vercel Deploy Previews).

---

## 9. üíª Developer Experience

- [ ] Integrate **Storybook** with R3F scenes.
- [ ] Provide **VSCode snippets** for Canvas, lighting, loaders.
- [ ] Generate **API docs** with Typedoc.
- [ ] Enable live asset reloads (GLTF/Textures hot reload).

---

## 10. üöÄ Deployment & Production

- [ ] Publish shared packages to npm (public or private).
- [ ] Cache assets (models/textures) via CDN.
- [ ] Precompute lightmaps & AO.
- [ ] Add error boundaries and fallback `<Canvas>` UI.

---

‚úÖ With these improvements, your monorepo will be **future-proof, dev-friendly, and production-grade**.
