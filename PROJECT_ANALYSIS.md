## 🔧 Critical Issues Found

### High Priority

1. **Version Inconsistencies**: Different Three.js versions across packages
2. **Missing Build Configurations**: Some packages lack proper Vite configs
3. **Dependency Mismatches**: Root and package dependencies don't align

### Medium Priority

1. **Test Coverage**: Limited test files in packages
2. **TypeScript Support**: Mixed JS/TS setup needs standardization
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Some packages missing detailed docs

### Low Priority

1. **Code Style**: Minor formatting inconsistencies
2. **Performance**: Opportunity for build optimization
3. **Security**: Some outdated dependencies

---
