# Terminal Cleanup Automation

This workspace now includes automatic terminal cleanup functionality that prevents stuck sudo prompts and other terminal issues from interfering with your npm commands.

## How It Works

Every npm command now automatically runs a cleanup script before executing to ensure:

- âœ… Stuck sudo processes are terminated
- âœ… Terminal state is clean
- âœ… Environment variables are cleared
- âœ… Commands run smoothly without password prompts

## Commands Available

### Automatic Cleanup (Recommended)

All npm commands now include automatic cleanup:

```bash
npm run dev        # Auto-cleans, then runs dev
npm run build      # Auto-cleans, then builds
npm run test       # Auto-cleans, then tests
npm run lint       # Auto-cleans, then lints
npm run batman     # Auto-cleans, then runs Batman
```

### Manual Cleanup

If you need to clean terminals manually:

```bash
npm run cleanup-terminals  # Interactive cleanup with messages
npm run cleanup           # Shorthand for cleanup-terminals
```

### Silent Cleanup

For scripts and automation:

```bash
npm run cleanup-terminals --auto  # Silent cleanup, no output
```

## What Gets Cleaned

1. **Stuck sudo processes** - Automatically terminated
2. **Environment variables** - Clears `SUDO_ASKPASS`, `SUDO_COMMAND`, `SUDO_USER`
3. **Terminal state** - Ensures clean command execution

## Benefits

- ðŸš€ **Faster development** - No more waiting for password timeouts
- ðŸ”§ **Reliable builds** - Commands always start with clean state
- ðŸ§¹ **Auto-maintenance** - Cleaning happens automatically
- ðŸ’ª **Batman integration** - Works with all Batman scripts

## Technical Details

The cleanup system uses:

- `pkill -TERM -f sudo` to gracefully terminate sudo processes
- Environment variable cleanup for security
- Promise-based async execution for reliability
- Automatic integration with all npm scripts

## Usage Examples

```bash
# These all automatically clean terminals first:
npm run dev              # Start development with clean terminals
npm run build            # Build with clean terminals
npm run test             # Test with clean terminals
npm run batman           # Run Batman with clean terminals

# Manual cleanup if needed:
npm run cleanup          # Show cleanup process
npm run cleanup --auto   # Silent cleanup
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter sudo prompts:

1. Run `npm run cleanup` to manually clean terminals
2. Check for background processes with `ps aux | grep sudo`
3. Use `Ctrl+C` to interrupt stuck commands
4. Restart your terminal if issues persist

The cleanup system is designed to be fail-safe and won't interfere with legitimate sudo usage when needed.
